# PAMepi - Platform for Analytical Models in Epidemiology

It is very important that the scientific discoveries have a reach bigger than the scientific community. The idea of the Platform is to provide free access to information in an interactive and didactic way.

We developed a website using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript to englobe data, visualization, and outreach areas. The interactive part of the website was developed in Shiny. For now, we offer content about Covid-19 but soon we will include other diseases.

This folder contains only the Frontend part of the project. The website can be accessed from this link: [https://modelacovid19.rondonia.fiocruz.br/](https://modelacovid19.rondonia.fiocruz.br/).
